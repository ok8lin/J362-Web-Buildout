            <p>Griffy’s Art Supply is navigating what it means to be a locally-owned art store in a college town. </p> 
            <p>For a long time, a convenient resource for Bloomington artists was Pygmalion's Art Supply. The store was around for almost 50 years and became a fixture in the community. However, it permanently shut its doors in June of 2020. </p>

            <p>Not even a year after Pygmalion’s close, AJ O’Reilly decided that Bloomington wasn’t Bloomington without an art store. Griffy’s Art Supply began as an online art store but became a tangible location in March of 2021. Located off of West Kirkwood Avenue, the store is a quick walk from Bloomington’s town square.</p>
            <p>When coming up with the concept of Griffy’s, O’Reilly says he wanted it to be a business that is rooted in the Bloomington community just like Pyg’s was. </p>
            <p> “Coming up with the name of Griffy’s, we wanted it to feel like a Bloomington staple and had been here for a long time, says AJ O’Reilly, store owner. “We don’t want it to feel like a big box store. We want it to feel like a mom-and-pop shop, which it is.”</p>

            <p>Currently, Griffy’s is the only locally owned art supply store in Bloomington and is a huge resource for IU art students. They have even teamed up with art professors to create specific supply kits for different art classes offered on campus. </p>
            <p>“It’s a really easy thing to have and I always have access to it", says Miranda Perez, IU Studio Art Major. "That makes getting my art supplies easier, especially when I have a last-minute project I need to buy something for.”</p>
            <p>Art is a major part of Bloomington’s community and can be seen in various spots around the city. Pygmalion’s was a key supplier for many local artists and Griffy’s is a current resource that is bringing that artistry back to Bloomington. </p>
            <p>"Just bringing creativity back to the community that we kind of lost", says general manager, Keller Makemson. "I think that Bloomington isn’t Bloomington without an art store. So Griffy’s is filling in that gap that Pygmalion’s left when they closed." </p>

            <p style="line-height: 2rem";>The Covid-19 pandemic majorly impacted the employment numbers in the art, entertainment, and recreational industry. Members of this industry include musicians, dancers, art teachers, art supply workers, studio artists, as well as digital artists like photographers and graphic designers.  In April of 2020, you can see an extreme drop in the number of workers where the employment rates are cut in half. The rate slowly increases but is seeming to curve out at a rate lower than how it was in February of 2020. It is more important now more than ever to support those who work in the arts in order for the industry to thrive again. </p>

              <h4>Three Reasons Why Small Businesses Are Important</h4>
              <ol>
                <li class="list"><strong>Small Businesses Provide Job Opportunities</strong>
                  <figcaption> According to the <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2022/04/26/small-business-facts-small-business-job-creation/">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>, small businesses have created 12.9 million new jobs in the span of 25 years. Jobs created by small businesses represents two of every three jobs created nationwide. </figcaption>
                </li>
                <li class="list"><strong>Employees Are Usually Happier</strong>
                  <figcaption> <a href="https://www.aflac.com/business/resources/aflac-for-small-businesses/happiness-report/default.aspx/">Aflac's Small Business Happiness Survey in 2018</a> found that 65% of employees find working at a small business to be less stressful than working for a large business. Futhermore, a mighty 87% thought that working at a small business is generally more fun than working at a large business. </figcaption>
                </li>
                <li class="list"><strong>They Help the Local Economy</strong>
                  <figcaption> Successful small businesses have the chance to bring visitors to the local community. This creates a way for more people to contribute to the local econmy as well. The creation of jobs is also a key factor in supporting the local economy because the revenue is going back to local workers that can invest their earnings into the community. </figcaption>
